          Hi there, ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ayub Mohamud and I am from London. I have recently graduated from the university of Hertfordshire with an Economics degree ðŸŽ“, however it was not something that I was too keen on. I have always been an individual who enjoys thinking laterally as well as logically and that is what brought me here to make this application ðŸ˜Š.

  <h2><u>Why coding?</u></h2>
  
  <p>
      After taking some time away from working , I was encouraged by a friend who was from a previous cohort ( Mohamed Osman), to try coding. Once I started, I had realised that the more I learnt and understood different concepts the more I wanted to learn. Therefore before I knew it I was doing the prerequisite tasks. 

      I have realised that with coding, you have to think creatively because sometimes the answer is not as obvious it may seem. Therefore, it can be stressful if you cannot solve a problem after hours of trying, but with persistence and dedication I knew somehow I would be able to solve it, and once I did the feeling was incredible.

<h2>Founders and coders X Ayub</h2>
<hr/>
<p> Once Mohamed described founders and coders as â€˜life changingâ€™ I was instantly hooked. After attending meet ups on Mondays and attending the short course on Tuesdays, I was amazed at the atmosphere and diversity. I started speaking to new coders, some of the course facilitators and Dan Sofer, I knew I could not let this opportunity pass. 

    The main thing I want to gain from founders and coders is being able to help other young people in my area and make them more knowledgeable. Coming from an area, were young adults are resulting to crime and drugs as they believe there is nothing else they can do to make a living, is upsetting and it is something which I want to prevent and change. Therefore with the knowledge I will gain from founders and coders, I want to help individuals by teaching them how to code and one day open up something similar to founders and coders for young people so they do not have to result to crime.  </p>
